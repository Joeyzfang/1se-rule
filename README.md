# 1se-rule
## This R program is used to estimate the performance of 1 se rule in cross validation when tuning logistic model.
This is the cleaned version of code used by paper "The out-of-sample prediction performance of the one standard error cross validation criterion for tuning a logistic prediction model". The code would contain 4 main parts: i) standard error of cross validation error; ii) accuracy of variable selection; iii) out-of-sample prediction error; iv) meta-model building.

In standard error of CV error section, simulation involves both lasso and ridge. We only conducted estimation analysis on lasso's performance.
Due to the massive amount of computing time and too many raw data files, we provided data that could be visualized directly.
