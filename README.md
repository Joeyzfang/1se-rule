# 1se-rule
## This R program is used to estimate the performance of 1 se rule in cross validation when tuning logistic model.
The estimation would contain 3 main parts: i) standard error of cross validation error;
ii) accuracy of variable selection; iii) out-of-sample prediction error. 
The fourth part is meta-model building.

In standard error of CV error section, simulation involves both lasso and ridge. We only conducted estimation analysis on lasso's performance.
